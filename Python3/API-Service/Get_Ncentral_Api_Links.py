def get_api_root(base_uri, access_token):
    """
    SYNOPSIS
    Retrieve links to other endpoints from the API root.

    DESCRIPTION
    This function makes a GET request to the /api endpoint to retrieve links to other available endpoints.

    ARGUMENTS
    base_uri : str
        The base URI of the API endpoint
    access_token : str
        The access token needed for authentication

    OUTPUTS
    dict
        A dictionary containing the links to other endpoints

    NOTES
    - This function requires the requests library to be installed.
    - Error handling is implemented for common HTTP errors and connection issues.
    - Extensive debug logging is included to aid in troubleshooting.

    USAGE_EXAMPLE
    base_uri = "https://api.example.com"
    access_token = "your_access_token_here"
    links = get_api_root(base_uri, access_token)
    print(links)

    PROMPT
    Read the OpenAPI Spec and using the details and parameters for the GET /api endpoint, write a helper function that would accept those parameters as arguments and returns the output as a JSON object.
